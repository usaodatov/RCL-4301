RCL-4301 Pseudocode and Python Scripts

This repository contains pseudocode and Python implementations developed as part of the RCL-4301 module coursework. 
The purpose of this project is to solve mathematical conditions and demonstrate the use of loops, conditional statements, and basic programming principles.

Features
Provides pseudocode for logical tasks using clear and structured steps.

Implements Python scripts for:
-Validating numbers (n) based on mathematical conditions.
-Calculating valid values for a second condition (d).


Project Structure
-pseudocode_4301.py:
Contains pseudocode and Python code for validating numbers (n) based on the condition 3n + 2 < 20.
-pseudocode_4301a.py:
Includes pseudocode and Python code for validating values (d) where 150 - 10d > 30.
